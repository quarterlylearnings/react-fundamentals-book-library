# COR Book Library

This is a hands-on guide where you will learn how to build a simple but fully functional library application using React, building upon the foundation that we created in class with the [`cor-library`](https://github.com/quarterlylearnings/cor-library). You should start by forking that repo.

Our library app will allow us to manage a collection of books, organized by genre on different shelves. We'll be able to add new books to a shelf, add new shelves to our library, and navigate through our collection using a clean and intuitive interface.

Throughout these lessons, we'll cover a range of topics including:

- Building functional components with React
- Managing state with the `useState` hook
- Lifting state up to share data between components
- Adding routing to our app with `react-router-dom`
- Refactoring our app to use `styled-components` for styling

By the end of these lessons, you'll have a solid understanding of how to build a React application, manage state with hooks, and add routing to create a single-page application. 

> It is so important that you spend the time and effort reading the code and explanations _before_ you start writing. Copying and pasting saves you time today but makes tomorrow much more difficult. Use your mind to engage with the material - you are a professional.
